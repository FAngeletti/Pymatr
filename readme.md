This python library gathers tools and functions
related to (http://perso.quaesituri.org/florian.angeletti/Publications/Journal?filter=tags%3E[Matrix%20representation] "random vectors with a matrix representation").
In brief, this random variable are characterized by a joint probability
density function which can be written as a matrix product:
p(x_1,.., x_n) = tr(A^T R(x_1) ... R(x_n) ).
This specific library focuses on the analysis and computation
of the limit laws for the sum of such random vector.

Examples are provided in the test directory.
